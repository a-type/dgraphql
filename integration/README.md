This is kind of a collection of useful stuff for testing the library end-to-end.

There's a docker-compose config for Dgraph itself, taken straight from their docs.

There's also a seed script which will reset the database to a 'clean' dataset.

Finally, there's the test suite we use for integration testing. It probably needs a better home.
